# NOTE: we don't use these resouces, they are commented out in the
# root local/kustomization.yml file.
# This is how Portal adds app files to the server so the main app image doesn't
# need to be constantly rebuilt, but it adds a large layer of complexity
# (they use `kubectl kustomize` and `sed` to replace a {{CODE_PATH}} variable
# to create a temporary k8s manifest) and I couldn't get it working right.
