# Alerts

Pull alerts from Portal and display them. Note that the Portal connection isn't set up yet but that we are able to define our own alerts.

## Adding an alert

1. Visit the Django admin page at https://libraries.cca.edu/django-admin
1. Go to the alerts section
1. **Add Alert**
1. Fill out the form. The chosen ID doesn't particularly matter if you're not matching Portal, you can use HTML in the alert text, and you don't have to specify a link (though even if you don't, you have to leave a value in the link text).

We should use alerts sparingly as they are alarmist but this can be a very useful tool.
