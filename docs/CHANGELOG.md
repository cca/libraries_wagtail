# Changelog

## 2.1.1

**2019-06-03** - several bugfixes, a few for problems introduced in the last release.

### Bugfixes

- [#77](https://github.com/cca/libraries_wagtail/issues/77) fix issues with Staff page mobile view
- [b049573](https://github.com/cca/libraries_wagtail/commit/b0495738b0777e3a82a89a0e53a9a8efd42bcb9f) `{% spaceless %}` filter proved problematic (can remove textual space between inline HTML tags like `<a>`, smushing them together). Also researched `django-htmlmin` but it a) doesn't work with GZip middleware & b) seems ill-maintained
- [c28b312](https://github.com/cca/libraries_wagtail/commit/c28b3120131d0d18ef1fe7fa2a8ac4d10177cb74) Instagram segment of home page could overflow boundaries if text contained very long words (e.g. URL or very long hashtag)
- Schema.org data could be malformed if text contained quotes or a script tag appeared early on in the page body
- Fix vulnerabilities identified by GitHub (fstream NPM package, Django rest framework)
- Update to Wagtail 2.5.1
